## _**Note**_

_**Use with caution**_

> This Stopwatch is not entirely accurate in timing _[Recorded some amount of deviation compared to other stopwatch interface from **my phone (Android 13)**, **laptop (Windows 11)** and **iPad (iPadOS 15)**]_.                 

_**If you may, please leave a comment on how I could improve the accuracy of my stopwatch as well as my App overall structure**_
